#### Are there unit tests for the API?

the unit testing and API testing activities are owned by different teams. Unit testing is almost always an activity that is owned by the development team; developers are expected to build unit tests for each of their code modules (these are typically classes, functions, stored procedures, or some other ‘atomic’ unit of code), and to ensure that each module passes its unit tests before the code is included in a build. This practice makes a lot of sense because it helps the developers solidify their code. Often times, this effort requires debugging and bug-fixing in real-time.
